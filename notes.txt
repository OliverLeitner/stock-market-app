0NEGUY: it won't matter that it's in a nested component, you should just change the autocomplete-results to a <router-link> and then reference this to set up dynamic routes
0NEGUY: https://router.vuejs.org/guide/essentials/dynamic-matching.html
0NEGUY: @click the items and then call the api for data to display
0NEGUY: if you want to do same page
creativenull: you can start aiming for the each item click show info thingy u were talking about before and limit the api search
0NEGUY: https://lodash.com/docs/#debounce
creativenull: so like delay the api call after they're done typing
